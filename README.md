# ❄️ What's Winter?

</div>
Our team, Winter developers, wants to make a flexible, user-friendly and cloud-oriented solution for creating beautiful notes, articles, knowledge bases to group your clutter in one place, like chaotic snowflakes that eventually add up to one beautiful snow shroud.
Winter will allow you to organize your ideas and plans in the form of flexible but simple records. having the ability to refer to others in one entry, you form a whole system of notes. there may be several such systems, each of which contains entries on a specific topic, it may be:

- your personal knowledge base, marked as private and accessible only to you;
- documentation on your project, accessible only to those people to whom you have given access to it;
- the history of the world, your book, accessible to everyone so that everyone can explore your world closer.

### 🌟 brief description of the functions:
- creating knowledge bases;
- defining privacy settings for knowledge bases; 
- using the markdown format for easy creation of notes;
- the ability to share knowledge bases and edit individual documents at the same time;
- etc...

It is planned that our project will have open source code and the ability to deploy winter locally. It is possible that winter will work in a decentralized manner. Web 3.0?
